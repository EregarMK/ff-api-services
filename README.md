## How to update your fork
Add the remote, call it "upstream":

```git remote add upstream https://github.com/FLOWFACT/ff-api-services.git```

Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches,
such as upstream/master:

```git fetch upstream```

Make sure that you're on your master branch:

```git checkout master```

Rewrite your master branch so that any commits of yours that aren't already in upstream/master are replayed on top of that other branch:

```git rebase upstream/master```
